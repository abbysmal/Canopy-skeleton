# Canopy - A git-blogging unikernel 🌿 

Canopy is an attempt at writting a blog engine based on Git using [MirageOS][mirage].

The goal is to provide a simple blog platform that requires only a few modifications in a configuration file and a Git repository respecting some architecture rules.

Canopy is written in OCaml using MirageOS and [Irmin][irmin], but it is currently only available on the Unix platform. The Xen platform will be supported as soon as [Decompress][decompress] is ready to be used in Irmin. :-)

## Getting started

You will need the latest version of `OCaml`, `opam` and `mirage` before starting. To setup a mirage environment, please refer to the mirage website.
You'll also need `bower` and `less-css` if you want to compile and retrieve everything related to the blog-styling (not needed to just test things out).

Checkout Canopy repository, then go inside:

```sh
# Get js/css dependencies and compile Less files
./style.sh
# Configure the mirage application
mirage configure --unix
# Compile Canopy
make
```

Then you'll be able to launch Canopy using `./mir-canopy`, that will launch a server listening on port `8080` by default.

To configure how your Canopy instance should behave, you can edit `canopy_config.ml` before running `make`.

```ocaml

let config = {
  remote_uri = "https://github.com/Engil/__blog.git"; (* the git repository *)
  index_page = "Index.md"; (* the file that will serve as an index page *)
  port = 8080; (* listening port *)
  push_hook_path = "push"; (* set this to a random string that will be used to inform that new content is available in the git repository *)
}
```

## How Canopy works

Canopy will require you to provide a Git remote uri. Once started, it will clone in-memory the repository content and serve the content in a more or less organized way.

Each file at the root of the repository is considered a standalone page, more like the usual « About » or « Contact » pages. They will have their own entries in the navigation menu.

Each directories will contains more pages, but that will be classified under a category decided by the name of the said directory.
For example, a `posts/hello-word.md` file will be a new blog post under the `Posts` category.
You can use it to emulate some sort of tag, like for example having an `OCaml` directory regrouping all you writing in everyone's favorite language. :-)

The file syntax is just plain markdown, everything should be supported out-the-box (depending on the `ocaml-cow` markdown implementation), with a little bit of extra informations absolutely needed at the top of each files.
